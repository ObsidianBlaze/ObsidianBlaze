### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is Idada Osaigbovo James but I go by Osas.
âš¡ Honestly, I am an atypical guy. Why? Well, I love Java and Python. I do not engage in those banter that slanders one for another.
âš¡ I am a natural Java Developer. After all, I have James in my name, like James Goslin.
ðŸ˜„ I learn really fast and I am confident on my learning speed.
ðŸ˜„ As much as I am eccentric, I have a penchant for collaborating with and leading a team.
ðŸ’¬ I am pretty good with Java EE, SE, and Andriod, Python, Php and Laravel, Javascript, Microsoft sql server
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an enterprise application with laravel as the sole backend developer(I am badass :-> )!
